# *A Comprehensive Investigation on the Long-run and Short-run Determinants of U.S. Equity Market*

**‚úèÔ∏è Introduction**: Existing literature has provided plenty evidence on the associations between equity price movement and macroeconomic variables, but few jointly considers the effects outside economic fundamentals such as investor behavior. So using a vector error correction model, this study aims to investigate the long-run and short-run determinants of the U.S. equity market based on economy, valuation and sentiment dimensions.

## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Objectives 
- Include broader dimensions of factors, other than economic factors, such as valuation and sentiment that could potentially impact stock prices
- Explore how the timing of the pricing factors impact stock prices, both short-run and long-run, using the built-in mechanism of the vector error correction model
- Apply the *"short-run and long-run determinants"* concept to improve the performance of strategic and tactical asset allocation strategy

## üìç Conclusions
- Valuation and sentiment are two important dimensions of factors for equity pricing
  - There is a significant long-run relationship between P/E ratio, trading volume and S&P 500
  - P/E ratio is significantly associated with S&P 500 in the short run
  - P/E ratio has relatively high explanatory power on S&P 500 in variance decomposition
- The timing of how these factors drive equity prices matters
  - P/E ratio has a negative effect on S&P 500 in the short run but positive in the long run
  - CPI is negatively related on S&P 500 in the short run but positive in the long run
- The long-run and short-run mechanism of VECM could improve strategic and tactical asset allocation
  - The impacts of the factors on S&P 500 come in different durations, allowing investment managers to enhance their allocations
  - Lucas (1997), F√ºss & Kaiser (2007)‚Äôs studies show that VECM is able to optimize asset allocation with different planning horizons
